The boot flex goes hand in hand with the classic 48oz felt tongue with exposed injected metatarsal guard in the Supreme M4 skates. This tongue will be a classic tried and true felt tongue that will give you comfort and help each stride give you maximum performance when you skate. Moving on to the interior of the Supreme M4, Bauer has gone with a hydrophobic microfiber liner which is designed to keep your feet locked into place, as well as quickly wick away sweat, providing you with ultimate feel and control while on the ice. Down to the holder of the Supreme M4 skates, the Blade Holder is the popular TUUK Lightspeed Edge holder that has been tested and played with at elite levels for years now.

The CCM Tacks AS-V Pro Senior Ice Hockey Skates are built for strength and power while being extremely lightweight. This skate provides superior energy transfer and a closer fit, to support the most intense skating strides. Starting with the fit, the Tacks AS-V Pro Skates feature a close to the foot anatomical fit that players are accustomed to with the Tacks line. This form-fitting, 360-degree fit around the forefoot, heel, and ankle helps eliminate negative space within the boot, allowing for more efficient energy transfer meaning improved speed and agility. Staying with the boot, the Tacks AS-V Pro Skates utilize CCM’s one-piece “Power” boot technology. This boot is for the modern power skater with intense strides. The Tacks AS-V Pro look to give explosiveness without restriction right from push off. Players will get more direct energy transfer and a closer to the foot fit to help keep them as fast and agile as possible on the ice. This one piece boot is built with RFM composite carbon which is a premium carbon material that delivers the best energy transfer possible within the boot. It will be a 215 stiffness which is super lightweight and thermoformable for ultimate skating performance. On the front of the AS-V Pro skate is CCM’s replaceable metatomic tongue with D30 foam. This multi-layer 7mm tongue will have an asymmetrical flex point for a better wrap and the D30 smart material insert will help to disperse the force of direct impacts, such as blocked shots, away from the sensitive ankle areas. The interior of the Tacks AS-V Pro Skates are loaded with comfort and durability-enhancing features. The TotalDri Pro+ liner with Polygiene is an elite-performance moisture-wicking material that helps wick moisture away from the body, keeping them dry and light on their feet. The interior multi-density memory foam in the ankle areas wrap anatomically around players’ ankles keeping them comfortably locked into place. On the back of the skate, the Powerflex carbon tendon guard, gives improved range of motion for fuller strides and increased skating power. Lastly, for the footbed, CCM is using their Ortholite Ultralite footbed with heel grip. This will offer premium comfort and support using recycled EVA foams. Moving to the bottom half of the Tacks AS-V Pro Skates, CCM utilizes their popular SpeedBlade XS holder. These holders were developed as a quick and easy way for players to replace runners on the fly, while ensuring a consistent feel every time. The holders utilize a positive-lock mechanism that tightly secures the runners to the holder to prevent the blade from loosening during gameplay. If you are an elite level skater looking for a powerful and responsive skate, that allows you to customize your performance level, look no further than the CCM Tacks AS-V Pro Senior Ice Hockey Skates. New for 2020 are CCM’s Step Steel XS Black Stainless Steel Runners. These runners take the widely popular design and features of Step Steel to fit on a CCM skate. Step Steel is made to increase the height of the runner to get more aggressive and tighter turns. Black Steel is made to have a longer lasting edge life."
