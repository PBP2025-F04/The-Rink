On the interior of the skates, the JetSpeed FT690 Hockey Skates feature CCM’s TotalDri Liner with Polygiene. This is a high-performance moisture-wicking material that keeps feet dry and skates light. Polygiene will help with superior odor and bacteria protection. An additional added EVA layer will help deliver major fit and comfort, while multi-density foam pads with seamless comfort finish will wrap anatomically around your foot for more added protection and comfort. For maximum comfort on your feet, The JetSpeed FT690 will feature a molded CCM Ortholite Ultra footbed. This will give ultra lightweight comfort, a molded fit, and heel grip support. Moving to the bottom half of the JetSpeed FT690 Hockey Skates, CCM is continuing with their superior SpeedBlade XS holder!

New for this year is an enhanced dial for better bladelock and faster changes on the fly. The consistently tightly secured blade maximizes energy transfer from the boot to the holder and from the holder to the blade in every stride. Partnered with the new SpeedBlade XS holder are the STEP Steel (+4mm) runners! These runners are made of the highest quality steel with increased height and 3mm thickness, giving you better edge control and letting you dig into the ice with more confidence.

Helping with the energy transfer in the boot, the Supreme M4 skates will feature a traditional facing flex.

Not only will this make your strides more powerful but also more efficient, so that you are getting the most out of every stride and no energy is wasted. The boot flex goes hand in hand with the classic 48oz felt tongue with exposed injected metatarsal guard in the Supreme M4 skates. This tongue will be a classic tried and true felt tongue that will give you comfort and help each stride give you maximum performance when you skate. Moving on to the interior of the Supreme M4, Bauer has gone with a hydrophobic microfiber liner which is designed to keep your feet locked into place, as well as quickly wick away sweat, providing you with ultimate feel and control while on the ice. Down to the holder of the Supreme M4 skates, the Blade Holder is the popular TUUK Lightspeed Edge holder that has been tested and played with at elite levels for years now. Bauer LS+ runners will come stock on the M4 which will allow you to fine tune your blade shape and performance with a profile ready 10ft geometry.
