With an all-new explosive kick combined with a stable release, the Novium Pro hockey stick is looking to be the perfect stick for the versatile two-way player on the ice. The most unique and improved area for the Novium Pro stick, is the all-new Bevel Taper. This is a “V” shaped taper that is designed to be stiffer throughout the taper, and softer up by the hands. This provides increased control and improved velocity on shots. This will also allow the stick to load much higher and really give extra power and pop on both shots and passes. For the construction of the Novium Pro, Warrior is using a brand-new weave, Minimus carbon 25. This new weave allows the stick to be stronger while reducing the weight. This weave will run through the entire shaft and blade, which allows the stick to feel more balanced and provide you with a feel that is not too blade heavy or top heavy. This will give the player maximum playability with the stick. Accompanying the Minimus Carbon 25 is revolutionary lightweight construction 199 or RLC 199. This is Warriors highest grade construction and uses the most advanced material selection and processing technologies to produce the highest quality and most lightweight stick. RLC 199 combines the latest in modern carbon composites technology, using the lowest weight fibers and thermoplastics, along with toughened epoxy resin to provide optimal performance and balance in the players hands. This ultimately will give you enhanced velocity, control and response. Internally, Warrior equipped the Novium Pro with Fuelcore Pro Blade technology, which is a newly redesigned blade. Fuelcore Pro is unique to the Novium stick and will give the most responsive feel and gives a lot of pop on your shots and passes. It has a single rib that runs down the center of the blade with a polymer core that provides that increased feel on the blade. To further increase the blade durability Warrior has included minimus carbon 25 weave around the core, helping the blade to breakdown less and add to its longevity. Rounding out the blade is a texture which will help increase grip on the puck allowing for the most control. If you are an elite level player, who is looking for a high-performance stick designed to be incredibly balanced and give you an incredibly powerful shot, look no further than the Warrior Novium Pro Junior Hockey Stick. 35 & 40 Flex - 48"" 50 Flex - 54"""

Building on 20 years of research and know-how, the LX stick line will feature Dynamic Strike technology. Whether taking hard shots from the blue line or puck handling in tight situations, the LX 20 is a versatile stick that will improve any player’s game. The Alpha LX 20 will continue with the predominantly gray and black color scheme seen in the DX stick with a little bit more gray thrown in this time. This gives it more of a sleek toned-down look. Moving down into the bottom of the stick the Alpha logo will pop with their nice neon yellow-green color standing out strong against the black and gray. This creates an overall nice subtle look, while still having some visual pop to it. Upgraded for the Alpha LX 20 Hockey Stick is Warrior’s exclusive Sabre Taper II Technology. This exclusive taper design combines a specialized geometry shape with a low kick flex that is torsionally stable and provides players with a more powerful and accurate release. Added to this is a brand-new laminate design which helps to reduce weight and allows it to recoil faster on shots. Moving into the construction of The Alpha LX 20, Warrior is using a revolutionary construction called R.L.C 155. Revolutionary Lightweight Construction 155 is a premium-grade carbon construction that provides the ultimate in bending strength and impact resistance. This will help you to achieve the most out of your stick in any situation. Along with that is a select blend of high elongation fibers and toughened resin chemistry that helps to provide pro level strength and performance. The Alpha LX 20 is lighter and tougher than ever. The material used for the construction is Warrior’s Minimus Carbon UD material. These are unidirectional carbon fiber weaves that are high strength flat weaves which are more dynamic and elastic than ever before, providing players with superior feel in all aspects of the game. Moving to the blade, the Alpha LX 20 Hockey Stick uses a FuelCore Pro Blade. This lightweight polymer blade core enhances puck feel and control and allows for shots to pop. It also will reduce the breakdown of materials in the blade with increased durability. Added to this is the Minimus Carbon 6 weave around the core of the blade. This weave allows the blade to be lighter without sacrificing the durability. The blade will also have added texture that will increase grip on the puck. On the comfort aspect, the Alpha LX 20 Hockey Stick offers an Ergo Shaft Shape. This ergonomic contour shaft shape is designed to fit more comfortably and securely into players’ hands. In turn, this design helps enhance control of the stick during stickhandling and shooting. Additionally, a soft grip known as Apex Performance Grip, has been added to the shaft providing ultimate control and feel. Thanks to the improved Sabre Taper and Dynamic Strike technology, the Alpha LX 20 Hockey Stick is ready to strike anytime, anywhere. Whether you are a forward who takes quick snapshots or a defenseman who takes slapshots from the blue line, the Warrior Alpha LX 20 Junior Ice Hockey Stick is perfect in any situation! 50 Flex: 54” 40 Flex: 51” 35 Flex: 48”"

Engineered with cutting-edge technology and premium materials, this stick is designed to elevate your performance to new heights. Whether you're a competitive player or a seasoned pro, the Hyperlite 2 will be your ultimate companion on the ice. The Vapor Hyperlite 2 is crafted with high-quality materials, making it one of the lightest sticks on the market, weighing in at 360 grams (SR). The reduced weight translates into quicker puck handling and improved maneuverability, giving you the edge in fast-paced situations. Utilizing ACL 2.0, it is also a very durable stick. This technology, inspired by the ADV stick, is a design in which carbon fibers are strategically layered within the shaft, giving the Hyperlite 2 increased durability and overall feel. It uses less material without sacrificing durability. Furthering this is the Hyperlite 2 MonoComp Construction. This is a molding process that eliminates the fusion point between the shaft and blade, making the Vapor Hyperlite 2 a true one-piece stick. This provides players with an unmatched and consistent feel during stickhandling, passing, and shooting. The Vapor Hyperlite 2 Hockey Stick features an ultra-low kick point thanks to the addition of the XE Taper technology. This taper is narrower and oval shaped. This design helps stabilize the lower portion of the shaft, as well as the blade, during hard wrist shots, helping improve accuracy and control during shooting. This design also reduces the overall weight of the stick. Moving down to the blade, the Vapor Hyperlite 2 Hockey Stick utilizes Bauer’s HYPERCORE2 Blade Core. This revolutionized carbon bridge construction increases recoil 10% to release the puck even more like a rocket. This core will also help to maintain that “Pop” feel in the blade longer. This is done without sacrificing the lightweight feel or performance. Like previous iterations, the blade on the Hyperlite 2 is very stiff, allowing the puck to fly off your blade on your shots! Engineered to elevate your skills and redefine your playmaking abilities, this stick sets the gold standard for on-ice performance. Whether you're a seasoned pro or an aspiring young talent, the Hyperlite 2 will elevate your game in all aspects."
