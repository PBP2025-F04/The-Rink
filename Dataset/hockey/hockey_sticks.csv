Whether you're a competitive player or a seasoned pro, the Hyperlite 2 will be your ultimate companion on the ice. The Vapor Hyperlite 2 is crafted with high-quality materials, making it one of the lightest sticks on the market, weighing in at 360 grams (SR). The reduced weight translates into quicker puck handling and improved maneuverability, giving you the edge in fast-paced situations. Utilizing ACL 2.0, it is also a very durable stick. This technology, inspired by the ADV stick, is a design in which carbon fibers are strategically layered within the shaft, giving the Hyperlite 2 increased durability and overall feel. It uses less material without sacrificing durability. Furthering this is the Hyperlite 2 MonoComp Construction. This is a molding process that eliminates the fusion point between the shaft and blade, making the Vapor Hyperlite 2 a true one-piece stick. This provides players with an unmatched and consistent feel during stickhandling, passing, and shooting. The Vapor Hyperlite 2 Hockey Stick features an ultra-low kick point thanks to the addition of the XE Taper technology. This taper is narrower and oval shaped. This design helps stabilize the lower portion of the shaft, as well as the blade, during hard wrist shots, helping improve accuracy and control during shooting. This design also reduces the overall weight of the stick. Moving down to the blade, the Vapor Hyperlite 2 Hockey Stick utilizes Bauer’s HYPERCORE2 Blade Core. This revolutionized carbon bridge construction increases recoil 10% to release the puck even more like a rocket. This core will also help to maintain that “Pop” feel in the blade longer. This is done without sacrificing the lightweight feel or performance. Like previous iterations, the blade on the Hyperlite 2 is very stiff, allowing the puck to fly off your blade on your shots! Engineered to elevate your skills and redefine your playmaking abilities, this stick sets the gold standard for on-ice performance. Whether you're a seasoned pro or an aspiring young talent, the Hyperlite 2 will elevate your game in all aspects."

This unique stick shape geometry also improves the response of the stick and allows the stick to feel more stable and play stronger. Moving on to the construction, the QR5 Pro is lighter and tougher than ever thanks to the Minimus Carbon UD, which is a high strength, lightweight unidirectional carbon design that is more efficient and helps to keep the stick as durable as possible. Accompanying the Minimus Carbon UD is revolutionary lightweight construction 188 or RLC 188. This is Warriors highest grade construction and uses the most advanced material selection and processing technologies to produce the highest quality and most lightweight stick. RLC 188 combines the latest in modern carbon composites technology, using the lowest weight fibers and thermoplastics, along with toughened epoxy resin to provide optimal performance and balance in the players hands. This ultimately will give you enhanced control and response. Internally, Warrior equipped the QR5 Pro with Fuelcore Ultra Blade technology, which is a newly redesigned blade. Fuelcore Ultra reduces breakdown of materials in the blade and increases the durability and feel. The lightweight polymer blade core enhances puck feel and pop. To further increase the blade durability Warrior has included minimus carbon 25 weave around the core, helping the blade to breakdown less and add to its longevity. Rounding out the blade is a texture which will help increase grip on the puck allowing for the most control. Lastly, the Covert QR5 Pro has slide grip, which are textured zones only where you need them to provide optimum grip and control. Grip textures have been removed from other areas to make it easy on the player to slide their hands up and down for poke checks, face offs, and puck battles. If you are an elite level player, who is looking for a top-tier stick designed for the quickest release possible, while staying extremely lightweight, look no further than the Warrior Covert QR5 Pro Senior Hockey Stick.
